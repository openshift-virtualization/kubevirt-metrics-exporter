# KubeVirt Metrics Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for OpenShift Virtualization that combines storage I/O latency tracing with VM memory and THP observability. It runs as a DaemonSet with several independent collection subsystems in a single container:

- **QMP subsystem** — connects to each VM's QEMU Monitor Protocol to collect per-disk read/write/flush latency histograms directly from the hypervisor
- **QGA subsystem** — uses the QEMU Guest Agent to collect guest-side I/O latency and IOPS from Windows VMs via Windows Performance Counters (PDH raw counters)
- **eBPF subsystem** — attaches kernel tracepoints and kprobes to capture block and NFS I/O latency across the node, correlated to Kubernetes pods and PersistentVolumeClaims
- **KVM subsystem** — reads KVM hypervisor event counters (exits, hypercalls, TLB flushes, halt exits) from the kernel debugfs at `/sys/kernel/debug/kvm/`
- **Cgroup subsystem** — reads per-VMI cgroup v2 memory stats (anonymous, THP) from QEMU process cgroups; per-node buddy/pagetype THP readiness (`/proc/buddyinfo`, `/proc/pagetypeinfo`); and kernel thread CPU (`khugepaged`, `ksmd`) plus KSM profit

All subsystems are independently enabled/disabled and degrade gracefully if one fails to start.

## Metrics

The exporter instruments several points along the I/O path from guest application to storage backend:

```
Guest application
  │
  ▼
Guest OS block layer ◄──── QGA: guest-side latency & IOPS (Windows only)
  │
  ▼
Storage virtqueue ◄─────── QMP: queue_inuse / queue_size (saturation, virtio/scsi)
  │
  ▼
QEMU block backend ◄────── QMP: I/O latency histogram (hypervisor-side)
  │
KVM (hypervisor) ◄───────── KVM: exits, hypercalls, tlb_flush, halt_exits
  │
  ├──► Host block layer ◄─ eBPF block: block_rq_issue → block_rq_complete
  │
  └──► Host NFS client ◄── eBPF NFS: nfs_initiate_* → nfs_*_done
         │
         ▼
       Storage backend
```

When diagnosing latency, compare metrics across layers: if QMP latency is high but eBPF block latency is low, the bottleneck is in the virtio/QEMU layer. If both are high, the problem is in the storage backend. If guest-side (QGA) latency is high but QMP latency is low, queuing is building up inside the guest.

For memory and THP, see [THP and node memory readiness](#thp-and-node-memory-readiness) and the cgroup metrics below.

VMI-level storage and KVM metrics use the `kubevirt_vmi_*` prefix. Per-VMI cgroup memory from this exporter uses `container_memory_*` (CRI-O-aligned). Exporter operational, eBPF, and node buddy metrics use `kme_*`.

### QMP metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_io_latency_seconds` | histogram | namespace, name, node, disk, persistentvolumeclaim, operation | Per-disk I/O latency for KubeVirt VMs |
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_queue_inuse` | gauge | namespace, name, node, disk, persistentvolumeclaim, queue, bus | In-flight descriptors in a storage virtqueue (`bus="virtio"` for virtio-blk disks, `bus="scsi"` for virtio-scsi controllers; `disk` and `persistentvolumeclaim` are empty for SCSI) |
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_queue_size` | gauge | namespace, name, node, disk, persistentvolumeclaim, queue, bus | Capacity (max descriptors) of a storage virtqueue (see queue_inuse for label semantics) |
| `kme_qmp_scrape_errors_total` | counter | | Errors during QMP poll cycles |
| `kme_qmp_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | Unix timestamp of last QMP poll |

The `bus` label distinguishes `virtio` (per-disk virtio-blk devices) from `scsi` (shared virtio-scsi controller). For virtio-scsi, `disk` and `persistentvolumeclaim` are empty because the virtqueues belong to the shared controller rather than any individual disk.

### QGA metrics (guest-side, Windows)

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_guest_latency_avg_seconds` | gauge | namespace, name, node, disk, persistentvolumeclaim, operation, drive | Average guest-side I/O latency per disk (read/write), derived via Little's Law |
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_guest_iops` | gauge | namespace, name, node, disk, persistentvolumeclaim, operation, drive | Guest-side IOPS per disk (read/write) |
| `kme_qga_scrape_errors_total` | counter | | Errors during QGA poll cycles |
| `kme_qga_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | Unix timestamp of last QGA poll |

The `disk` label contains the KubeVirt volume name (e.g. `rootdisk`), populated by correlating guest PCI addresses (from the `guest-get-disks` QGA command) with libvirt domain XML disk aliases (`ua-<volumeName>`). The `drive` label contains the raw Windows PhysicalDisk name (e.g. `"1 E:"`). The `persistentvolumeclaim` label is derived by mapping volume names to PVC claim names via the VMI `status.volumeStatus`. If disk mapping is unavailable (e.g. old guest agent), `disk` and `persistentvolumeclaim` are empty.

Disk mapping limitations:
- Disk mappings are established when the VMI is first discovered. Volumes hotplugged after that point are not tracked (their `disk` and `persistentvolumeclaim` labels will be empty).
- SATA disks can only be mapped when a `serial` is explicitly set on the disk in the VM spec. This is a QEMU guest agent limitation. Without `<serial>` the label `persistentvolumeclaim` will be empty.

The QGA subsystem collects raw Windows Performance Counters (`Win32_PerfRawData_PerfDisk_PhysicalDisk`) via `wmic` executed through the QEMU Guest Agent. Metrics are computed by diffing two successive counter snapshots using Little's Law to derive latency from uint64 queue-length counters (avoiding uint32 overflow in the direct latency counters). VMs without a guest agent (e.g., Linux) or with `guest-exec` blacklisted are automatically detected and excluded after a configurable number of retries.

### eBPF metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kme_block_io_latency_seconds` | histogram | node, namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, pod, operation | Block I/O latency attributed to pod volumes |
| `kme_system_block_io_latency_seconds` | histogram | node, device, operation | Block I/O latency for system/unresolved devices |
| `kme_nfs_io_latency_seconds` | histogram | node, namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, pod, operation | NFS I/O latency (tracepoint-based) |
| `kme_nfs_vfs_latency_seconds` | histogram | node, namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, pod, operation | NFS VFS call latency (kprobe-based) |
| `kme_subsystem_active` | gauge | subsystem | Whether an eBPF subsystem loaded successfully (1) or not (0) |

### KVM metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kubevirt_vmi_kvm_exits_total` | counter | namespace, name, node, pod | Total KVM VM exits (guest→hypervisor transitions) |
| `kubevirt_vmi_kvm_hypercalls_total` | counter | namespace, name, node, pod | Total KVM hypercalls issued by the guest |
| `kubevirt_vmi_kvm_tlb_flushes_total` | counter | namespace, name, node, pod | Total KVM TLB flush events |
| `kubevirt_vmi_kvm_halt_exits_total` | counter | namespace, name, node, pod | Total KVM exits triggered by guest halt instructions |
| `kme_kvm_scrape_errors_total` | counter | | Errors during KVM debugfs poll cycles |
| `kme_kvm_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | Unix timestamp of last KVM poll |

Counters are read from `/sys/kernel/debug/kvm/<pid>-<fd>/` and aggregated across all KVM file-descriptor entries for a single QEMU process. A high exit rate relative to vCPU time indicates the guest is spending significant cycles in hypervisor context. A high `halt_exits` rate is normal for idle VMs (vCPUs sleeping) but abnormal for CPU-intensive ones.

### Cgroup metrics

Per-VMI memory metrics (aligned with [CRI-O PR #10143](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/10143)):

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `container_memory_active_anon_bytes` | gauge | namespace, name, node, pod | Active anonymous memory in bytes |
| `container_memory_inactive_anon_bytes` | gauge | namespace, name, node, pod | Inactive anonymous memory in bytes |
| `container_memory_anon_thp_bytes` | gauge | namespace, name, node, pod | Anonymous memory backed by transparent hugepages in bytes |
| `container_memory_shmem_thp_bytes` | gauge | namespace, name, node, pod | Shared memory backed by transparent hugepages in bytes (kernel 6.8+) |
| `container_memory_file_thp_bytes` | gauge | namespace, name, node, pod | File-backed memory backed by transparent hugepages in bytes |

Per-node kernel thread and KSM metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kme_cgroup_khugepaged_cpu_seconds_total` | counter | node | Cumulative CPU time consumed by the khugepaged kernel thread |
| `kme_cgroup_ksmd_cpu_seconds_total` | counter | node | Cumulative CPU time consumed by the ksmd kernel thread |
| `node_ksmd_general_profit_bytes` | gauge | | Net memory saved by KSM after subtracting tracking overhead (aligned with [node_exporter PR #3778](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/pull/3778)) |
| `kme_node_thp_split_pmd_total` | counter | node | THP page table downgrades (`thp_split_pmd` from `/proc/vmstat`) |
| `kme_node_thp_collapse_alloc_total` | counter | node | Successful THP collapses by khugepaged (`thp_collapse_alloc` from `/proc/vmstat`) |
| `kme_node_movable_bytes_order_ge_9` | gauge | node, numa | Movable-capable free buddy memory at page order ≥9 in bytes (buddy minus pagetype Unmovable and Isolate) |
| `kme_node_movable_bytes_all_orders` | gauge | node, numa | Movable-capable free buddy memory across all orders in bytes (buddy minus Unmovable and Isolate) |
| `kme_node_buddy_bytes_order_ge_9` | gauge | node, numa | Total free buddy memory at page order ≥9 in bytes (exact, Normal zone, `/proc/buddyinfo`) |
| `kme_node_buddy_bytes_all_orders` | gauge | node, numa | Total free buddy memory across all orders in bytes (exact, Normal zone, `/proc/buddyinfo`) |
| `kme_node_unmovable_bytes_order_ge_9` | gauge | node, numa | Unmovable free buddy memory at page order ≥9 in bytes (Normal zone, `/proc/pagetypinfo`) |
| `kme_node_unmovable_bytes_all_orders` | gauge | node, numa | Unmovable free buddy memory across all orders in bytes (Normal zone, `/proc/pagetypinfo`) |
| `kme_cgroup_scrape_errors_total` | counter | | Errors during cgroup poll cycles |
| `kme_cgroup_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | Unix timestamp of last cgroup poll |

Per-VMI gauges come from cgroup v2 `memory.stat` on each QEMU process. Node buddy, pagetype, and vmstat THP counters come from host `/proc` (Normal zone, per NUMA node). The `container_memory_*` naming aligns with the [CRI-O cgroup memory proposal](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/10143); `node_ksmd_general_profit_bytes` aligns with [node_exporter PR #3778](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/pull/3778).

VM resident and domain memory (`kubevirt_vmi_memory_resident_bytes`, `kubevirt_vmi_memory_domain_bytes`) are scraped from virt-handler / KubeVirt, not from this exporter — see the dashboard and [THP and node memory readiness](#thp-and-node-memory-readiness) sections for how those metrics are used alongside KME cgroup and buddy gauges.

### Example PromQL

P99 write latency per VMI:
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (name, le) (
    rate(kubevirt_vmi_storage_io_latency_seconds_bucket{operation="write"}[5m])
  )
)
```

Virtqueue saturation per disk (ratio of in-flight descriptors to capacity):
```promql
kubevirt_vmi_storage_queue_inuse / (kubevirt_vmi_storage_queue_size > 0)
```

P99 host-side block I/O latency attributed to a pod's PVC:
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum by (namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, pod, operation, le) (
    rate(kme_block_io_latency_seconds_bucket{operation=~"read|write"}[5m])
  )
)
```

See [`docs/example-queries.md`](docs/example-queries.md) for a full per-metric query reference (storage, KVM, and exporter health). Memory and THP dashboard interpretation is in [THP and node memory readiness](#thp-and-node-memory-readiness) below.

## THP and node memory readiness

This section explains what the cgroup memory metrics above and the **KubeVirt VM Memory** Perses dashboard (`deploy/openshift/dashboard-memory.yaml`) represent, how they relate to the kernel memory manager, and how to interpret trends.

### Background: transparent huge pages (THP)

On typical x86-64 hosts (4 KiB base page size), **PMD-sized THP uses 2 MiB pages** (buddy **order 9**; each order *o* spans `4096 × 2^o` bytes per block). The kernel can promote anonymous and shmem mappings to THP and demote them again under pressure. Unless THP is fully disabled, the **`khugepaged`** kernel thread scans memory and attempts to **collapse** eligible small pages into huge pages. Policy (`always`, `madvise`, `never`, per-size controls on recent kernels) is described in the [Transparent Hugepage Support](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html) admin guide.

THP observability splits naturally into two questions:

1. **Guest / VM:** How much memory is **already** huge-backed?
2. **Node:** How much **free physical stock** can still support new 2 MiB allocations or khugepaged collapse on a given NUMA node?

The dashboard and KME metrics address both.

### Kernel sources

| Source | What it reports | Used for |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| `/proc/buddyinfo` | Free buddy **blocks** per zone and NUMA node, by **order only** (not migrate type). **Exact** block counts. | `kme_node_buddy_bytes_*` |
| `/proc/pagetypeinfo` | Same free-block shape, split by **migrate type** (Movable, Unmovable, Reclaimable, Isolate, …). Counts can be **capped** (e.g. `>100000`) when the kernel avoids long zone-lock holds. | `kme_node_unmovable_bytes_*`; input to movable derivation |
| cgroup v2 `memory.stat` | Per-QEMU `anon_thp`, `shmem_thp`, `file_thp`, etc. | `container_memory_*_thp_bytes` |
| `/proc/vmstat` | Node counters `thp_split_pmd`, `thp_collapse_alloc` | `kme_node_thp_*_total` |
| virt-handler metrics | libvirt `dommemstat` RSS and balloon/domain size | `kubevirt_vmi_memory_resident_bytes`, `kubevirt_vmi_memory_domain_bytes` |

**Buddyinfo vs pagetypeinfo:** Buddyinfo answers “how much free memory exists at each block size?” Pagetypeinfo answers the same question but splits counts by **migrate type** — the kernel’s label for whether free pages in a page block can be relocated during compaction, migration, or hugepage grouping:

| Migrate type | Typical meaning |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Movable** | Can be migrated/compacted; preferred for user allocations and THP grouping. |
| **Unmovable** | Pinned on the freelist (kernel structures, some DMA-related stock, etc.); not available for collapse as movable stock. |
| **Reclaimable** | File-backed pages on the freelist that can be reclaimed (metadata/cache) before reuse. |
| **Isolate** | Isolated blocks (debug/testing); treated like unmovable for THP readiness math in KME. |
| **Reserve** | Reserved for future movable use; not reported by KME. |

The kernel keeps migrate types separated within page blocks to limit fragmentation under mixed workloads.

KME reports **Normal zone only** (where most anonymous VM memory and THP activity live). Values are labeled by Kubernetes **node** name and **NUMA** node id from buddyinfo/pagetypeinfo.

### How KME derives buddy metrics

```
buddy (exact)          ← /proc/buddyinfo Normal zone
unmovable (+ isolate)  ← /proc/pagetypeinfo Normal zone (Unmovable and Isolate lines)
movable-capable        ← buddy − unmovable − isolate   (per NUMA, clamped at 0)
```

Exported gauges:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `kme_node_buddy_bytes_order_ge_9` / `_all_orders` | Total free buddy memory (all migrate types combined). |
| `kme_node_unmovable_bytes_order_ge_9` / `_all_orders` | Free buddy memory on the **Unmovable** migrate type only. |
| `kme_node_movable_bytes_order_ge_9` / `_all_orders` | **Movable-capable** free buddy: buddy minus Unmovable and Isolate freelist pages. |

**Important:** `movable-capable` is **not** the pagetypeinfo “Movable” line. Buddy total includes **Reclaimable** (and other) freelist pages that are not Unmovable or Isolate; those remain in buddy and are counted in `movable-capable` because only Unmovable and Isolate are subtracted. In practice, `movable-capable` is often **above** the pagetype Movable line at the same NUMA node; the gap is largely **reclaimable freelist** memory (and any other migrate types except Isolate).

**Why both `order_ge_9` and `all_orders` for unmovable?** They measure different things:

- **`unmovable_bytes_order_ge_9`** — free Unmovable blocks at order ≥ 9 (2 MiB+). This is the portion of **THP-sized** free buddy that cannot be used for collapse. It is required internally to compute `movable_bytes_order_ge_9` and is useful for alerts/debugging (“how much 2 MiB-class free stock is pinned unmovable?”).
- **`unmovable_bytes_all_orders`** — all free Unmovable blocks (orders 0–10). Most unmovable free memory usually sits in **small** orders; this line shows total pinned freelist footprint but does **not** substitute for ge9 when assessing immediate THP readiness.

The **KubeVirt VM Memory** dashboard plots **unmovable total** (`_all_orders`) plus ge9 movable-capable lines; it does not plot `unmovable_bytes_order_ge_9` separately because the gap `buddy_ge9 − movable_ge9` already reflects unmovable (and small reclaimable) stock at 2 MiB orders.

### Dashboard panels

**VM Memory**

| Panel | PromQL idea | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **THP / Resident** | `(anon_thp + shmem_thp) / resident × 100` (join `on(namespace, name, node)`; resident filtered with `kubevirt_vmi_info{phase="running"}`) | Share of **RSS** already backed by THP. Rising → more guest RAM in huge pages (successful collapse or huge-friendly allocation). Low → mostly 4 KiB pages. Denominator is libvirt RSS (`kubevirt_vmi_memory_resident_bytes`), numerator from QEMU cgroup `memory.stat`. |
| **Resident / Configured** | `resident / domain_bytes × 100` (same `node` join and `kubevirt_vmi_info` running filter) | Share of **ballooned domain size** actually resident. Context for memory footprint, not THP-specific. Low ratio with a large balloon means much “configured” memory is not in RAM. |

**Node — THP readiness (Normal zone, per NUMA)**

| Line | Metric | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **≥2 MiB movable-capable** | `movable_bytes_order_ge_9` | Best single **supply** signal: free 2 MiB-class buddy stock that is movable-capable on that NUMA node. |
| **movable-capable total** | `movable_bytes_all_orders` | All-order movable-capable freelist (includes small fragments that may coalesce). |
| **buddy free total** | `buddy_bytes_all_orders` | Raw buddy upper bound (includes reclaimable/unmovable free pages). |
| **unmovable total** | `unmovable_bytes_all_orders` | Total free Unmovable buddy (mostly small orders). |
| **MemAvailable** (dashed) | `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes` | **Node-wide** reclaimable-memory estimate from node-exporter. Not per-NUMA and not buddy stock; often **much larger** than buddy free because it includes reclaimable cache. Use for overall pressure context, not as “2 MiB THP pool size.” |

**Node — khugepaged & ksmd CPU**

`100 × rate(cpu_seconds_total[interval])` → approximate **% of one CPU core**.

- **khugepaged** — THP collapse / scanning activity. Bursts are normal when memory is being collapsed; sustained high rates under load warrant checking split vs collapse counters.
- **ksmd** — Kernel Samepage Merging (separate from THP). High ksmd CPU means active page merging; it competes for CPU but is not the same mechanism as THP.

**Node — THP split & collapse**

`60 × rate(vmstat_counter[interval])` → events **per minute**.

- **`thp_split_pmd`** — THPs split back to smaller pages (unmap, protection changes, pressure, fragmentation management).
- **`thp_collapse_alloc`** — Successful collapses by khugepaged.

Counters are **lifetime** totals; the dashboard shows **recent rate**. Near-zero rates mean a quiet window, not disabled THP. Rising splits with flat collapses suggest THP churn or pressure.

### Reading trends together

| Pattern | Likely meaning |
|---------|----------------|
| movable ge9 ↑ | More immediate 2 MiB-capable free stock on that NUMA node. |
| movable ge9 ↓ while VM resident ↑ | Guest RAM growing faster than 2 MiB free stock replenishes; new THP formation may slow. |
| unmovable ge9 ↑ (or large `buddy_ge9 − movable_ge9`) | More THP-sized free memory is **not** movable-capable. |
| collapse_alloc rate ↑ | khugepaged actively forming THPs. |
| split_pmd rate ↑, collapse flat | THPs being torn down faster than formed — check pressure, mapping churn, or policy. |
| VM THP/Resident ↑ | Guest using more huge-backed RAM. |
| VM THP/Resident low, movable ge9 high | THP opportunity not yet taken (policy, workload, or khugepaged not needed yet). |
| MemAvailable high, movable ge9 low | Common: plenty of reclaimable cache globally, but **buddy freelist** at 2 MiB orders is still tight. |

### Caveats and limitations

- **Pagetype saturation:** Fields like `>100000` in pagetypeinfo are a **floor**, not an exact count. Affected orders in unmovable/movable derivations can be **undercounted**; buddyinfo totals at the same order remain exact. Prefer buddy ge9 for exact 2 MiB **total** free; treat pagetype-derived unmovable at saturated orders as approximate.
- **Order 0:** Pagetype per-order sums can diverge from buddyinfo at **order 0** on some kernels; orders **8–10** typically align. Rely on **ge9** lines for THP-sized conclusions.
- **Reclaimable freelist:** `movable-capable` subtracts only Unmovable and Isolate; **Reclaimable** free buddy pages remain in the residual. That makes `movable-capable` larger than the pagetype Movable line and can include pages that are not as readily usable for collapse as strictly Movable stock.
- **Isolate migrate type:** Subtracted in movable-capable math but not included in the exported `unmovable_*` gauges (only the Unmovable line is exported as unmovable).
- **Resident vs cgroup anon:** RSS and cgroup `anon` are related but not identical; small gaps in THP/Resident are expected.
- **Scope:** Buddy/pagetype metrics describe **free** Normal-zone buddy pages per NUMA node, not used memory, not DMA32/HighMem zones, and not hugetlbfs pools.
- **Policy:** Metrics show stock and activity, not sysfs THP policy (`/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/…`). Low VM THP with `never` or without `MADV_HUGEPAGE` is expected regardless of movable ge9.

## Alerting

Prometheus alerting rules are included in `deploy/prometheus-rules/` and deployed automatically with `make deploy` / `make deploy-kubernetes`.

The rules cover two areas:

**Workload health** — alerts on high storage I/O latency (hypervisor-side, guest-side, and node-side) and virtqueue saturation:

| Alert | Severity | Condition |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| VMIStorageWriteLatencyHigh | warning | P99 write latency > 100ms for 10m |
| VMIStorageReadLatencyHigh | warning | P99 read latency > 100ms for 10m |
| VMIStorageFlushLatencyHigh | warning | P99 flush latency > 500ms for 15m |
| NodeVMStorageLatencyWidespread | critical | >50% of active VMs on a node with P99 > 100ms for 10m |
| VMIDiskSaturated | critical | Aggregate virtqueue occupancy > 90% for 5m |
| VMIGuestStorageLatencyHigh | warning | Guest-side avg latency > 100ms for 15m |
| PVCBlockLatencyHigh | warning | P99 block latency > 100ms for 10m |
| PVCNFSLatencyHigh | warning | P99 NFS latency > 250ms for 10m |

**Exporter health** — alerts when the exporter itself is unhealthy or producing stale data:

| Alert | Severity | Condition |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| KMEQMPPollStale | warning | QMP poll > 5 min stale |
| KMEQGAPollStale | warning | QGA poll > 5 min stale |
| KMEKVMPollStale | warning | KVM poll > 90s stale |
| KMECgroupPollStale | warning | Cgroup poll > 90s stale |
| KMEQMPScrapeErrors | warning | Sustained QMP errors for 15m |
| KMEQGAScrapeErrors | warning | Sustained QGA errors for 15m |
| KMEKVMScrapeErrors | warning | Sustained KVM errors for 15m |
| KMECgroupScrapeErrors | warning | Sustained cgroup errors for 15m |
| KMEeBPFSubsystemDown | warning | Block eBPF subsystem down for 10m |
| KMEAbsent | critical | No metrics scraped for 10m |

The `KMEAbsent` alert uses the Prometheus `up` metric with `job="kubevirt-metrics-exporter"`. If your PodMonitor uses a different job name, update the alert expression to match.

QMP histogram latency values reported in alert annotations are approximate due to the default histogram bucket granularity (10ms, 100ms, 1s). For higher precision, configure finer-grained boundaries via `--boundaries`.

## Exporting historical KME metrics

`scripts/export-kme-metrics.py` exports every metric defined by this exporter from a Prometheus-compatible server using its range-query API. This includes `kme_*`, `kubevirt_vmi_*`, `container_memory_*`, and `node_ksmd_general_profit_bytes` series, while excluding generic Go/process metrics supplied by the Prometheus client library. It exports the preceding 24 hours at 30-second resolution by default, matching the PodMonitor scrape interval, and writes the API's JSON response to a timestamped file.

The script requires Python 3. Automatic service discovery and port-forwarding additionally require `oc` or `kubectl`; no `jq`, `curl`, or platform-specific `date` implementation is required.

```bash
./scripts/export-kme-metrics.py
```

The exporter `/metrics` endpoint only provides the current scrape; historical export requires Prometheus, Thanos, or another compatible query server that retains the requested period. By default the script discovers `svc/thanos-querier` (first in `openshift-monitoring`, then cluster-wide), port-forwards it, and uses the current `oc` token when available. Pass `--server` to use an already reachable query server instead. Pass `--start`, `--end`, and `--step` for a fixed window, and use `--bearer-token` (or `PROMETHEUS_BEARER_TOKEN`) and `--ca-file` when the server requires authentication or a custom CA. Timestamps use RFC 3339 and work on macOS and Linux. Run `./scripts/export-kme-metrics.py --help` for all options.

To override discovery, explicitly select a resource for the managed `oc`/`kubectl` port-forward:

```bash
./scripts/export-kme-metrics.py --port-forward svc/thanos-querier --namespace openshift-monitoring
```

It prefers `oc` when available, otherwise uses `kubectl`, waits for the forwarded endpoint, and stops the background process when the export finishes or fails. Use `--local-port`, `--remote-port`, `--port-forward-scheme http`, or `--client kubectl` to override those defaults.

Use `--vmi-namespace` and `--vmi-name` to restrict the range query to a VMI. The filters apply to the Prometheus `namespace` and `name` labels, so node-only metrics and pod-level eBPF metrics without those labels are intentionally excluded from a VMI-filtered export. `--port-forward-namespace` controls where the query service is discovered; the legacy `--namespace` spelling remains an alias for it.

For large windows, pass `--gzip` to compress the single JSON response. The default filename then ends in `.json.gz`. Alternatively, `--output -` writes only the response body to standard output, so it can be streamed into another tool:

```bash
./scripts/export-kme-metrics.py --output - --gzip > kme-metrics.json.gz
```

Pass `--output-format openmetrics` to convert the returned range samples to OpenMetrics text instead. This is useful for producing local TSDB blocks with `promtool`; it is a sampled export at the selected `--step`, not a Prometheus backup.

```bash
./scripts/export-kme-metrics.py --output-format openmetrics --output kme-metrics.om
promtool tsdb create-blocks-from openmetrics kme-metrics.om ./tsdb-blocks
```

## Building

Prerequisites: Go 1.25+, clang, llvm, libbpf-devel

```bash
make build        # generates eBPF bindings and builds the binary (requires clang/llvm)
make test         # runs all tests (requires generated eBPF bindings)
make test-unit    # runs unit tests for non-eBPF packages (works on macOS)
make image        # builds container image with podman (includes full toolchain)
```

To build and push a custom image:

```bash
make push IMAGE=quay.io/myuser/kubevirt-metrics-exporter TAG=v0.1.0
```
